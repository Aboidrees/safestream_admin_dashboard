# Production Authentication Redirect Fix

## Issue Description

**Problem**: After successful login in production, users are not redirected to the dashboard. Instead, they remain on the login page.

**Symptoms**:
- ✅ Login succeeds (credentials accepted)
- ✅ JWT token is created with correct fields
- ✅ Session cookie is set
- ❌ User is not redirected to dashboard
- ❌ User remains on `/login` page

**Root Cause**: NextAuth's redirect callback was returning the URL `/login` after authentication because it matched the "same origin" check, creating a redirect loop.

---

## Production Logs Analysis

```
🔄 Redirect callback - url: https://admin.safestream.app/login baseUrl: https://admin.safestream.app
🔄 Redirect callback - same origin, allowing: https://admin.safestream.app/login
```

**Problem Identified**: 
- The redirect callback received `https://admin.safestream.app/login` as the URL
- It returned this URL as-is because it matched the same origin
- This caused the user to be redirected back to `/login` instead of `/` (dashboard)

---

## Fix Applied

### File: `lib/auth.ts`

**Before**:
```typescript
async redirect({ url, baseUrl }) {
  // If it's the same origin, allow it
  if (url.startsWith(baseUrl)) {
    return url  // ❌ This returns /login after authentication
  }
  
  // Default redirect
  return `${baseUrl}/`
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
async redirect({ url, baseUrl }) {
  // Never redirect back to login page after authentication
  if (url.includes('/login')) {
    const redirectUrl = `${baseUrl}/`
    console.log("🔄 Redirect callback - avoiding login redirect, going to:", redirectUrl)
    return redirectUrl  // ✅ Always go to dashboard, never back to login
  }
  
  // If it's a relative URL, make it absolute
  if (url.startsWith("/")) {
    return `${baseUrl}${url}`
  }
  
  // If it's the same origin, allow it
  if (url.startsWith(baseUrl)) {
    return url
  }
  
  // Default redirect to dashboard
  return `${baseUrl}/`
}
```

**Key Change**: Added a check at the beginning of the redirect callback to intercept any URL containing `/login` and redirect to the dashboard instead.

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Login Flow:
1. User enters credentials on `/login`
2. `signIn()` is called with credentials
3. NextAuth authenticates the user
4. JWT token is created with admin fields
5. Session cookie is set
6. Redirect callback is invoked
7. **NEW**: If URL contains `/login`, redirect to `/` instead ✅
8. User lands on dashboard at `/`
9. Middleware validates token
10. Dashboard page loads

### Expected Logs:
```
🔄 Attempting login with: admin@safestream.app
🔐 Authorize called with credentials: { email: 'admin@safestream.app', hasPassword: true }
🔄 JWT callback - New token created: { ... isAdmin: true ... }
🎉 Admin sign in: { ... }
🔄 Redirect callback - url: https://admin.safestream.app/login
🔄 Redirect callback - avoiding login redirect, going to: https://admin.safestream.app/
✅ Login successful, redirecting to dashboard...
🔍 Middleware - Pathname: /
🔍 Middleware - Token: Present
✅ Admin authenticated, allowing access to: /
```

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Commit the Changes
```bash
cd /Users/aboidrees/development/safestream/admin_dashboard
git add lib/auth.ts
git commit -m "fix: prevent redirect loop to /login after authentication"
```

### 2. Push to Production
```bash
git push origin main
```

### 3. Verify Deployment
- Wait for Vercel/hosting platform to deploy
- Open browser to `https://admin.safestream.app/login`
- Enter admin credentials
- **Expected**: Redirect to `https://admin.safestream.app/` (dashboard)

### 4. Check Logs
Look for this log message in production:
```
🔄 Redirect callback - avoiding login redirect, going to: https://admin.safestream.app/
```

---

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Test Cases:
1. **Fresh Login**
   - Navigate to `/login`
   - Enter credentials
   - Click "Sign in"
   - **Expected**: Redirect to `/` (dashboard)

2. **Direct Dashboard Access (Authenticated)**
   - Already logged in
   - Navigate to `/`
   - **Expected**: Dashboard loads without redirect

3. **Direct Dashboard Access (Not Authenticated)**
   - Not logged in
   - Navigate to `/`
   - **Expected**: Redirect to `/login`

4. **Logout**
   - Click logout button
   - **Expected**: Redirect to `/login`
   - Session cleared

5. **Protected Routes**
   - Navigate to `/users`, `/families`, etc.
   - **Expected**: If authenticated, page loads; if not, redirect to `/login`

---

## Rollback Plan

If the fix causes issues, rollback by reverting the redirect callback:

```typescript
async redirect({ url, baseUrl }) {
  // If it's a relative URL, make it absolute
  if (url.startsWith("/")) {
    return `${baseUrl}${url}`
  }
  
  // If it's the same origin, allow it
  if (url.startsWith(baseUrl)) {
    return url
  }
  
  // Default redirect
  return `${baseUrl}/`
}
```

Then investigate alternative solutions.

## Alternative Solutions Considered

### Option 1: Fix in Login Page (Not Used)
Could modify `app/login/page.tsx` to not pass `callbackUrl` to `signIn()`:
```typescript
await signIn("admin-credentials", {
  email: formData.email,
  password: formData.password,
  redirect: false,
  callbackUrl: "/" // Force dashboard
})
```
**Rejected**: This doesn't solve the root cause; NextAuth still controls the final redirect.

### Option 2: Fix in Middleware (Not Used)
Could add special handling in middleware to redirect `/login` to `/` if authenticated:
```typescript
if (pathname === '/login' && token) {
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/", request.url))
}
```
**Rejected**: This adds complexity and doesn't address the redirect callback issue.

### Option 3: Fix in Redirect Callback (CHOSEN) ✅
Intercept `/login` URLs in the redirect callback and redirect to dashboard instead.
**Advantage**: Solves the issue at the source, clean and simple.

## Related Files

### Changed:
- ✅ `lib/auth.ts` - Updated redirect callback

### Related (No Changes):
- `app/login/page.tsx` - Already has circular redirect prevention
- `middleware.ts` - Token validation (working correctly)
- `components/admin-shell.tsx` - Logout button (using NextAuth signOut)
- `app/layout.tsx` - AuthProvider wrapper (working correctly)

---

## Additional Notes

### Why This Issue Occurred:
1. The login page sets `redirect: false` in `signIn()` to handle redirects manually
2. After successful authentication, `window.location.href = "/"` is called
3. However, NextAuth's redirect callback runs before this
4. The redirect callback received the current URL (`/login`) and returned it
5. This created a loop where the user stayed on `/login`

### Why the Fix Works:
1. The redirect callback now explicitly checks for `/login` in the URL
2. If found, it forces a redirect to `/` (dashboard) instead
3. This breaks the loop and ensures users always go to the dashboard after login
4. The middleware then validates the token and allows access

---

## Success Criteria

✅ Users can log in and are redirected to dashboard
✅ Dashboard displays without errors
✅ Middleware validates tokens correctly
✅ Logout works and redirects to login
✅ Protected routes are properly guarded
✅ No redirect loops
✅ Production logs show correct redirect flow

---

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor for:
- Number of successful logins
- Redirect callback logs
- Middleware validation logs
- User session duration
- Any authentication errors

**Expected Metrics**:
- Login success rate: > 95%
- Redirect loop incidents: 0
- Token validation failures: < 1%
